# Interpreting-Pima-Diabetes-Prediction-with-Shap-Eli5-LIME
LIME is short for Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations. Local refers to local fidelity — i.e., we want the explanation to really reflect the behaviour of the classifier “around” the instance being predicted. This explanation is useless unless it is interpretable — that is, unless a human can make sense of it. Lime is able to explain any model without needing to ‘peak’ into it, so it is model-agnostic. Behind the workings of LIME lies the assumption that every complex model is linear on a local scale and asserting that it is possible to fit a simple model around a single observation that will mimic how the global model behaves at that locality
